# Top Down Movement 2D

## About

This script makes the player move horizontally and vertically along a plane.  

## Using

 - Create a GameObject to act as the player.
 - Add a RigidBody2D component to the GameObject and set the body type as 'Kinematic'
 - Attach the script to the player object.  
 - Set the move speed in the inspector (0.1 is normally a good starting point).  
 - Higher values will make the player move further each frame.
