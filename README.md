# UnityScripts
A collection of useful reusable scripts for Unity I've created for myself, which others are welcome to use.  
They are intended to be as minimal and straightforward as possible so they can be used for a variety of different projects, and they should be relatively easy to adjust for any differing requirements.  
*Note that I mostly develop in 2D so 3D scripts may take longer to be created.*
