**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...]

**Describe the script you'd like**
A clear and concise description of what you want the script to be able to do. 'Complex' actions should be split into separate scripts to improve reusability (i.e. a platformer controller would not include any camera movement, that would be a separate script)

**Is it 2D or 3D (or both) - *if there would be any difference between 2D and 3D please raise them as separate issues***
